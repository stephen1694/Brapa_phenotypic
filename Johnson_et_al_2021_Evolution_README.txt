Brief overview of methods:
We combined experimental evolution with the resurrection approach to explore adaptation to experimental drought in Brassica rapa (field mustard). 
We founded 24 experimental populations from lines which originated from a natural population and randomly assigned each experimental population to a watering regime. We assigned 8 populations for storage as ancestors, 8 to receive four generations of experimental drought, and 8 to receive four generations of experimental well-watered conditions.
During these four generations of experimental evolution, drought regime populations received a draw-drown drought treatment aimed to mimic Mediterranean drought while well-watered regime populations were watered every other day. We collected data (flowering time, survival, and seed mass) on a subset of individuals each generation to explore trends in fitnesss and selection during experimental evolution.
After experimental evolution, we grew all experimental populations (ancestors included) under unstressed (well-watered) conditions to reduce maternal and storage condition effects across the different regimes.
We then grew two seeds (siblings) from 35 individuals per population while applying a watering treatment with one sibling from each individual under each treatment in what was the test generation. This design allowed us to assess evolutionary responses (ancestor-descendant regime comparisons), plasticity (watered-drought treatment comparisons), and consistency of responses (parallelism among replcates) to experimental drought. 
Detailed methods and the assocated results are discussed in the assocated manuscript published in Evolution.

Data files:
For each file, the data is found in the first tab while an explanation of each variable is provided in the second tab.  
The file named "Johnson_et_al_2021_Evolution_individuals_data.xls" includes traits measured for all individuals during the test generation of the experiment (flowering time, stem diameter, specific leaf area, and seed mass). 
The file named "Johnson_et_al_2021_Evolution_WUE_data.xls" contains data for water-use efficiency, which is a trait that was measured on population pools, during the test generation of the experiment. 
The file named "Johnson_et_al_2021_Evolution_EE_subset.xls" contains flowering time and seed mass information for 40 individuals per watering regime (drought or watered) for each generation (1-4) during experimental evolution. This was used to estimate survival and selection during the experiment. 

Code files:
The file named "Johnson_et_al_2021_Evolution_code.txt" contains all code used to generate results included in the Evolution journal article. This code is explained with comments throughout the text file.
